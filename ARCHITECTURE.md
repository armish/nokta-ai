## Detailed Layer Specifications

### 1. Input Processing Pipeline

#### 1.1 Case Normalization (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Simplify learning by reducing classification heads from 12 to 6
- **Process**:
  - Store original case pattern: `[True, False, True, ...]` for uppercase positions
  - Convert to lowercase with Turkish-specific rules:
    - `İ → i` (dotted capital to dotted lowercase)
    - `I → ı` (dotless capital to dotless lowercase)
    - Standard lowercase for other characters
- **Example**: "TÜRKIYE" → "türkiye" + case pattern `[T,T,T,T,T,T,T]`

#### 1.2 Input Layer
- **Input Shape**: `(batch_size, sequence_length, context_size)`
- **Context Window**: 96 characters (expert recommended)
- **Character Encoding**: ASCII codes (0-255) with bounds checking
- **Safe Character Handling**: Characters > 255 are replaced with spaces (ASCII 32)
- **Example**: For normalized "türkiye", each character gets a 96-char context window

### 2. Character Embedding Layer
```python
nn.Embedding(256, 128)
```
- **Vocabulary Size**: 256 (supports full ASCII + extended characters)
- **Embedding Dimension**: 128 (expert recommended, increased from 64)
- **Parameters**: 256 × 128 = **32,768**
- **Output Shape**: `(batch_size, seq_len, context_size, 128)`

### 3. Bidirectional LSTM Layers
```python
nn.LSTM(
    input_size=128,
    hidden_size=256,  # per direction
    num_layers=2,     # configurable (2-4)
    bidirectional=True,
    dropout=0.25
)
```
- **Architecture**: 2-layer bidirectional LSTM
- **Hidden Size**: 256 per direction (512 total output)
- **Dropout**: 0.25 between layers (expert recommended)
- **Parameters**: ~1,051,648 (for hidden_size=256, 2 layers)
- **Output Shape**: `(batch_size, seq_len, context_size, 512)`

#### LSTM Parameter Breakdown:
```
For each LSTM layer (forward + backward):
- Input-to-hidden weights: (128 + 256) × (256 × 4) = 393,216
- Hidden-to-hidden weights: (256 + 256) × (256 × 4) = 524,288
- Biases: 256 × 4 × 2 = 2,048
- Total per layer: ~919,552
- Total for 2 layers: ~1,839,104
```

### 4. Multi-Head Self-Attention Layer (Optional)
```python
MultiHeadSelfAttention(
    d_model=512,    # hidden_size * 2 (bidirectional)
    num_heads=4,    # expert recommended
    dropout=0.1
)
```
- **Input Dimension**: 512 (from bidirectional LSTM)
- **Number of Heads**: 4
- **Head Dimension**: 512 ÷ 4 = 128
- **Components**:
  - Query, Key, Value projections: `3 × (512 × 512)` = 786,432
  - Output projection: `512 × 512` = 262,144
  - Layer normalization: `512 × 2` = 1,024
- **Parameters**: **1,049,600**
- **Output Shape**: `(batch_size, seq_len, 512)`

#### Self-Attention Mechanism:
```
Q = Linear(512 → 512) → reshape to (batch, seq, 4, 128)
K = Linear(512 → 512) → reshape to (batch, seq, 4, 128)
V = Linear(512 → 512) → reshape to (batch, seq, 4, 128)

Attention = softmax(QK^T / √128) × V
Output = Linear(512 → 512) + LayerNorm(residual)
```

### 5. Classification Heads (6 Lowercase Diacritic Pairs)
```python
# Simplified from 12 to 6 heads (uppercase variants handled by case restoration)
# For each of the 6 Turkish diacritic pairs: c/ç, g/ğ, i/ı, o/ö, s/ş, u/ü
nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(512, 256),    # hidden_size * 2 → hidden_size
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(0.1),
    nn.Linear(256, 2)       # 2 variants per character pair
)
```
- **Number of Heads**: 6 (reduced from 12, only lowercase pairs)
- **Binary Classification per Character**:
  - Index 0: Keep base character (e.g., 's' stays 's')
  - Index 1: Add diacritic (e.g., 's' becomes 'ş')
- **Input Size**: 512 (from LSTM/attention)
- **Hidden Size**: 256
- **Output Size**: 2 (binary choice per character)
- **Parameters per head**: `(512 × 256) + 256 + (256 × 2) + 2` = 131,842
- **Total parameters**: 6 × 131,842 = **791,052** (50% reduction from 12 heads)

### 6. Case Pattern Restoration (Post-Processing)

#### Turkish-Specific Case Mappings
- **Unique Turkish Rules**:
  - `i → İ` (lowercase dotted to uppercase dotted)
  - `ı → I` (lowercase dotless to uppercase dotless)
  - This differs from English where `i → I`

#### Restoration Process
1. Model outputs lowercase predictions: "türkiye"
2. Apply stored case pattern: `[T,T,T,T,T,T,T]`
3. Turkish-aware uppercase conversion:
   - Position 0: t → T (standard)
   - Position 4: i → İ (Turkish-specific)
4. Final output: "TÜRKİYE"

## Training Details

### Loss Function
```python
nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
```
- **Binary Classification Loss**: Each character position with diacritic options
- **Label Encoding**:
  - Label = 0: No diacritic (e.g., 's' stays as 's')
  - Label = 1: Add diacritic (e.g., 's' becomes 'ş')
- **False Restoration Penalty**: Model is penalized equally for:
  - False positives (adding diacritic when it shouldn't)
  - False negatives (not adding diacritic when it should)
- **Frequency Weighting**: Characters weighted by inverse frequency in training data

### Training Data Processing
1. **Input Text**: "Türkiye Cumhuriyeti"
2. **Case Normalization**: "türkiye cumhuriyeti" + case pattern
3. **Diacritic Removal**: "turkiye cumhuriyeti" (training input)
4. **Target**: "türkiye cumhuriyeti" (with diacritics)
5. **Labels Generated**: Only for positions where characters have variants:
   - Position with 'u': label = 1 (ü)
   - Position with 'i': label = 0 (i, not ı)

## Data Flow Example

### Complete Pipeline Example
```
Original Input: "TÜRKIYE"
```

### Step 1: Case Normalization
```
Input: "TÜRKIYE"
Case Pattern: [True, True, True, True, True, True, True]
Normalized: "türkiye" (with Turkish rules: I → ı)
Training Input: "turkiye" (diacritics removed)
```

### Step 2: Context Window Processing
```
For character 'u' at position 1:
Context window (size=96): [padding...t, u, r, k, i, y, e...padding]
                                     ↑
                                 center (target)
```

### Step 3: Neural Network Forward Pass
```
1. Character Embedding: [96] → [96, 128]
2. BiLSTM Processing: [96, 128] → [96, 512] (bidirectional)
3. Center Extraction: [96, 512] → [512] (middle position)
4. Self-Attention (if enabled): [seq_len, 512] → [seq_len, 512]
5. Classification Heads:
   - 'u' classifier: [512] → [2] outputs [0.3, 0.7]
   - 'i' classifier: [512] → [2] outputs [0.8, 0.2]
```

### Step 4: Predictions (Lowercase)
```
Character predictions:
- t: no variant (unchanged)
- u: [0.3, 0.7] → index 1 → 'ü'
- r: no variant (unchanged)
- k: no variant (unchanged)
- i: [0.8, 0.2] → index 0 → 'i' (not 'ı')
- y: no variant (unchanged)
- e: no variant (unchanged)

Lowercase Result: "türkiye"
```

### Step 5: Case Restoration
```
Lowercase Output: "türkiye"
Case Pattern: [T, T, T, T, T, T, T]
Turkish Case Rules Applied:
- t → T
- ü → Ü
- r → R
- k → K
- i → İ (Turkish: dotted i becomes dotted İ)
- y → Y
- e → E

Final Output: "TÜRKİYE" ✓
```

## Key Architecture Improvements

### Case Normalization Benefits
- **50% Reduction in Classification Heads**: From 12 (with uppercase) to 6 (lowercase only)
- **Simplified Learning**: Model focuses on diacritic patterns, not case patterns
- **Deterministic Case Handling**: Perfect case preservation without learning
- **Better Convergence**: Fewer parameters and simpler decision boundaries
- **Improved Capital Letter Accuracy**: No confusion between İ/I variants during training

### Character Safety Features
- **Bounds Checking**: All characters clamped to 0-255 range
- **CUDA Compatibility**: Prevents assertion failures on GPU hardware
- **Unicode Handling**: Graceful fallback for characters outside ASCII range

### Loss Function Design
- **Balanced Binary Classification**: Equal penalty for false positives and negatives
- **Conservative Predictions**: Model learns when NOT to add diacritics
- **Frequency Weighting**: Rare characters get higher loss weights
- **Example**: For "kasap" (butcher):
  - 's' at position 2: Label = 0 (keep as 's')
  - If model predicts 'ş': Loss is incurred
  - Model learns context where 's' should remain unchanged
